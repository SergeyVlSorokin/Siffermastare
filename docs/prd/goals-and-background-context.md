# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
* **User Engagement:** Achieve a high rate of user engagement (average 3+ sessions/week).
* **Educational Effectiveness:** Demonstrate measurable improvement in user proficiency (e.g., 50% increase in accuracy/speed in 2 weeks).
* **Module Completion:** Drive users to master specialized modules (e.g., 60% of users complete one specialized module).

### Background Context
This PRD defines the requirements for "Siffermästare," a native Android application for learning Swedish numbers. Existing language apps lack deep, practical, and trackable practice for numerical comprehension. Learners struggle with auditory comprehension of spoken numbers, especially specialized formats like dates, times, and the *personnummer*.

This product solves this by providing a focused "listen-and-type" learning loop, progressive complexity, and dedicated modules for real-world number formats. The MVP will be an on-device app validating the core mechanic and tracking user accuracy and speed.
